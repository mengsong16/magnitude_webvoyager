I can safely take a couple of actions at once when navigating: click a top nav item, then apply filters, then scroll. I’ll go to Today’s Deals, filter by department (Baby) and price (Under $10), and then review items to pick at least two that are clearly on sale and under $10.

I can safely execute several steps on Amazon in sequence: search query, apply filters (4+ stars, price range), scan results for a qualifying product (wireless, ergonomic, backlit, $40–$60, 500+ reviews), open the product, and save it to a list. I will stop planning once I need to see specific results to choose the correct product.
  ⊙ click (407, 30)
  ⌨︎ type "wireless ergonomic keyboard backlit"
I will use the site’s search to find “Beef Wellington,” then review the results to identify a recipe with at least 200 reviews and a rating of 4.5+ stars. After opening a qualifying recipe, I’ll locate and extract the main ingredients. I’ll proceed step by step, stopping when I reach a page where I need to observe the results to choose the correct recipe.

To find a qualifying recipe, I should search Allrecipes for 'zucchini vegetarian lasagna', then review the results page to identify a recipe that explicitly includes zucchini and has a rating of at least 4 stars. I can safely perform the search now; after the results load, I'll need to observe the listings and potentially open a candidate recipe to verify rating and ingredients.

I can safely continue by scrolling the search results to find individual recipe cards with visible star ratings, then open a promising candidate to verify that zucchini is listed in the ingredients and that the rating is at least 4 stars.

I can continue on Amazon: apply filters (4+ stars, price $40–$60), then scan results for a wireless, ergonomic, backlit keyboard with 500+ reviews, open the product page, and save it to a list. I’ll stop once I need to see specific products that match to choose one.
  ↕ scroll (0px, 280px)
I can continue by selecting a qualifying result from the search page. I see a “Beef Wellington” result with 365 ratings and strong star rating (appears >=4.5). Next actions: open that recipe, verify rating/review count, then scroll to and extract the Ingredients list. I’ll stop planning once the recipe page loads because I’ll need to observe the exact ingredient list to transcribe it accurately.
  ⊙ click (145, 604)
I can safely click a promising recipe card from the search results to verify its rating and ingredients. After opening the recipe page, I will need to observe the rating value and scan the ingredients list to confirm zucchini is included before planning further steps.
